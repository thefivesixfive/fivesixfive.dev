<p>Minehut is a Minecraft server host that offers free servers in exchange for certain limitations.
While not so much anymore, I used to use Minehut frequently, to the point I once had three accounts.
Because I was so familiar with Minehut and its community I saw a glaring flaw: there was a full-fledged API
and no modules (at least for Python) that took advantage of it. So I made Minefob.

<p>The module quickly began being used and as of writing this Minefob has 5,000+ downloads. I was, and still am,
immensely proud of myself that I was able to find an issue and address it using my skills. So what went wrong?
Why did it break? Well, it's pretty simple. The

    closest thing to official documentation</a>
simply marks the login endpoint as 'depreciated'. So despite my best efforts the project remains permanently nonfunctional.</p>
