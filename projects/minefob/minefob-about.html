Minefob: the best Python module to control any Minehut server. Simply install with pip, login with your Minehut account, 
and have full access to your server through code.<br><br>
I made this module back in 2020 during the peak of COVID to control the Minehut server my friends and I played on frequently. It became
apparent to me there was no public Python module that did what mine could, so I published it on PyPi. The aptly named 'Minefob' took off and as of writing this
the module has over 5,000 downloads.<br><br>Unforunately the module is permanently nonfunctional at no fault of my own; rather, Minehut simply depreciated username and password authentication
through the API, leaving the only current way to log in through so convoluted it's easier for the end user to use the online control panel. Maybe one day
I'll make another module that works around this...
