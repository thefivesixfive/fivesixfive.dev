webeye is a simple webscraper that I built when I was 12. It features a robots.txt check and a simple breakdown of the site's HTML.
while the project falls short of many other scrapers available this software holds a special place in my heart as it was
the first ever software project I planned and completed. In retrospect I do see a lot of flaws in the code but I also see quite a bit of solid code as well.
Seeing what has and hasn't changed about the way I program is fascinating to me, and this project offers a perfect benchmark.
