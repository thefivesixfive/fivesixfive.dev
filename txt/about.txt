Greetings, fivesixfive here. I'm an indie game developer. Get in touch via contact@fivesixfive.dev

My real name is Caleb North, and I've been working with code for an upwards of 8 years. The love I have for the art of coding formed when I made a Scratch account in hopes of crafting my own games. Although I do have a couple classes under my belt, most of my knowledge is self taught. As such I'm fluent in Python and have solid experience in languages such as Java, C#, HTML, CSS, and GDScript.
I'm a proud homeschooler living in the deep south of Alabama. My favorite color is pink and my favorite food is pizza, but given that I'm a teenager I will eat pretty much anything put before me. My hobbies, in no particular order, include programming, hanging out with friends, listening to music, drawing, and playing video games. I'm also a devout Christian, but I don't identify with any particular political party.
