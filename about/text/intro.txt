<span style="font-size: 1.2vw">Greetings</span><br>
fivesixfive here. I'm a 15-year-old developer who likes coding a little too much.
Right now I'm making an online multiplayer game and uploading my progress to YouTube. 
Sometimes I stream if I'm in the mood, and I post to my socials if I'm not YouTubing.
<br><br>
My real name is Caleb North, and I've been working with code for an upwards of 8 years.
The love I have for the art of coding formed when I made a Scratch account in hopes of crafting my own games.
Although I do have a couple classes under my belt, most of my knowledge is self taught.
As such I'm fluent in Python and have solid experience in languages such as Java, C#, HTML, CSS, and GDScript.
<br><br>
I'm a proud homeschooler living in the deep south of Alabama. My favorite color is pink and my favorite food
is pizza, but given that I'm a teenager I will eat pretty much anything put before me. My hobbies, in no particular order,
include programming, hanging out with friends (in person and online), playing video games, listening to music, and drawing.
<br><br>
I'm also a devout Christian, but I don't identify with any particular political party.
<br>"There is a certain branch of Christianity that has so effectively hijacked the word Christian that I feel uncomfortable sometimes using it to describe myself. But I am a Christian.‚Äù
